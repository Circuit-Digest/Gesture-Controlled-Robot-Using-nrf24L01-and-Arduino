## 📜 Summary

The "**Gesture Controlled Robot Using nRF24L01 and Arduino**" project enables the creation of an impressive hand gesture-controlled robot using Arduino, MPU6050 Accelerometer, nRF24L01 Transceiver, and an L293D motor driver module. The project is divided into two parts: the Transmitter and the Receiver. The Transmitter, consisting of an Arduino Uno, MPU6050, and nRF24L01, captures hand gestures and wirelessly transmits data to the Receiver. The Receiver, comprising an Arduino Uno, nRF24L01, and motor driver, interprets the signals and controls the robot's movements accordingly. The step-by-step guide provides details on the hardware setup, circuit diagrams, code explanations, and testing procedures for creating this captivating gesture-controlled robot.
